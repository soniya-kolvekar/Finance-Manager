This is my very own project based on a problem statement 
problem statement: people especially students and adults facing problems managing their financial accountings.
Answer: This terminal app may not be perfect and is still in developing phase where I tend to add more features later on.. currently it has a system that management and makes account of your
* Income tracking 
* Expense tracking 
* Budgeting system 
* Goal based savings 
* Investment tracking 
* loan and debt management 
This app also supports multi user interface and can take accountability of many users at the same time.. It's also contains a inbuilt authentication system for the user to prevent security bleach.
In the future i want to add some other features like
* Exporting reports as graphs
* Balance and expense predictions 
* Bill reminders
* Automating recurring transactions
* Tax calculations
* Expense alerts and many more features
